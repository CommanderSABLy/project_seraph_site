            <h2>Premise</h2>
            <p>
                Project Seraph is a turn-based strategy game in which players control one of six factions. Each faction is loosely based on either traditional 
                fantasy races or Christian angelology/demonology. Each faction has unique units, strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and win conditions. In addition 
                to the factions, the world is also populated with monsters such as the Great Phoenix and the Hydra, which offer various boons to those that defeat them. 
                Compete against the other factions to shape the world for the future of your kind in Project Seraph!

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Project Seraph is heavily inspired by the 2004 PlayStation 2 game <span class="italic">Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</span> and the 
                <span class="italic">Civilization</span> series of 4X strategy games. <span class="italic">Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</span> is a 
                chess-like strategy game that I played a lot as a child. I played the game independently to improve my skills and build a strong set of units in 
                order to play against my father who did the same. The game was an interesting departure from chess for the both of us. Like chess, the board is a 
                square grid and each player has a piece they need to keep protected. Unlike chess, however, each piece has unique stats and one of three patterns for both 
                movement and attack, with eight available combinations. These patterns are a vertical and horizontal cross, a diagonal cross, and a box-like pattern that 
                uses only the space two away from the piece in each of the eight directions. The only combination of patterns not implemented is the box-like pattern for 
                both movement and attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                These patterns in particular are what inspired me to begin work on Project Seraph as I very quickly found what I perceived to be a flaw in the game design. 
                Pieces with either a diagonal/diagonal, diagonal/box, or box/diagonal movement/attack pattern were inherently less valuable than any other piece, regardless 
                of individual statistics. Those three combinations could be negated entirely by playing only on the spaces they could not reach, which was half of the entire 
                board. While I liked playing with a diversity of pieces, this simple flaw made it less competitive to do so. I wanted to make a game that could utilize this 
                same premise without this flaw.

            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                Gameplay is split into two distinct modes: a strategic mode and a tactical mode. In strategic mode, players can build and move armies across the world of Project 
                Seraph. This mode is similar to the <span class="italic">Civilization</span> series in that the board is hexagonal, armies take up one tile, tiles show terrain, 
                and cities exist on some tiles. Combat is treated very differently, however. Instead of the game running some calculations and playing a battle animation showing 
                the results of a fight, Project Seraph shifts to the tactical mode. In this mode, players take the units that made up their army and control them in the 
                <span class="italic">Capsule Monster Coliseum</span> inspired format. Both sides have a set number of Logistic Points which are expended when a unit performs an 
                action, with a certain amount replenished at the start of each turn. Each unit has its own health stat, a speed stat that determines how far it can move, a movement 
                pattern, an attack pattern, an attack strength, a defense stat, and a logistical cost. Logistical cost scales with a unit's power, allowing more weaker units to 
                perform actions for the same cost as a more powerful unit. Each unit can move and attack, attack, or perform a special ability each turn, provided the player has 
                enough Logistic Points to expend for the action. To remedy the pattern flaw <span class="italic">Capsule Monster Coliseum</span> experienced, all units have the 
                ability to attack one space in any direction in addition to their attack pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike <span class="italic">Capsule Monster Coliseum</span> and chess, there is no king analogue. A player is defeated when all their units are destroyed, they 
                surrender, or they retreat. Players have the option to retreat at any time. In order to do so, they must declare their retreat and bring their units to their edge 
                of the board and perform a retreat action on each of them. Doing so will result in a loss and surrender the hexagonal tile on the strategic mode to their opponent 
                but allow their units to survive to fight another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Monsters are treated as a PvE boss battle with the same view and mechanics as the PvP tactical mode. Each monster will have a unique set of attacks and abilities 
                to utilize in battle, as well as a unique reward for successfully defeating it. The currently planned monsters are the Great Phoenix, the Eldritch Horror, 
                the Dragon, Nemean Lion, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Hydra.
